Your code looks quite organized and functional! Here are some suggestions for improvement:

1. Error Handling: Ensure that you handle errors more gracefully. While you are logging errors to the console, you might want to consider handling them differently based on the context of the error. For example, you could retry certain operations or provide more informative error messages to the user.
2. Code Reusability: You have repeated fetch operations in multiple functions. Consider refactoring these into a single function that can be reused across different parts of your code. This can make your code more maintainable and reduce duplication.
3. Consistent Naming: Make sure your variable names and function names are consistent and follow a naming convention. For example, initAuth and createNewExperiment use camel case, while startExperiment, resumeExperiment, and stopExperiment use camel case with no separation between words. Consistency in naming makes your code easier to read and understand.
4. Modularization: Break your code into smaller, more manageable modules or functions. This will make it easier to understand and maintain. For example, you could create separate modules for authentication, experiment creation, experiment control (start, resume, stop), and data retrieval.
5. Comments and Documentation: While your code has some comments, adding more detailed explanations can help others understand your code more easily. Documenting the purpose of functions, parameters, and return values can be especially helpful.
6. Code Formatting: Ensure consistent code formatting throughout your codebase. Tools like ESLint can help enforce code style guidelines automatically.
7. Testing: Consider writing unit tests for your functions to ensure they behave as expected under different conditions. This can help catch bugs early and ensure the reliability of your code.
8. Security: Ensure that sensitive information like authentication tokens is handled securely. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly into your code and consider using environment variables or configuration files instead.
Applying these suggestions can help improve the readability, maintainability, and reliability of your code.
