# CHAI-PCR-API
# Project Overview

The Experiment Management API is a versatile tool designed to streamline the setup, management, and data retrieval of biological experiments on networked devices. This API facilitates the seamless coordination of experiment stages and steps, allowing for precise control and real-time data acquisition. Ideal for research settings, it empowers users to automate and manage complex experimental protocols while integrating robust data-handling and decision-making processes.

## Key Features

Experiment Creation: Easily set up new experiments with custom configurations and predefined parameters to ensure reproducibility and standardization.
Stage and Step Configuration: Define and modify experimental stages and steps, including cycle counts, temperature settings, and data collection preferences, allowing for flexible protocol management.
Real-Time Experiment Control: Start, pause, resume, and stop experiments as needed, ensuring adaptability to dynamic research requirements.
Amplification Data Retrieval: Access amplification data in real-time for monitoring and analysis, enabling informed decision-making mid-experiment.
Authentication Integration: Securely authenticate access to ensure data privacy and experiment integrity.
Applications

The Experiment Management API is designed for laboratory environments where precise control over experimental procedures is essential, such as:

Molecular Biology: For managing protocols in PCR, qPCR, and related amplification workflows.
Diagnostics: Automating testing procedures, especially where repeated measurements and data collection are required.
Clinical Research: Supporting data-driven research by integrating with devices that monitor biological responses, enabling the timely adjustment of experiments based on live data.
Technology Stack

API Endpoints: Built using RESTful principles to maintain consistency and ease of use.
Authentication: Secure token-based authentication to protect experimental data.
Customizable Configurations: Experiments are defined in JavaScript with flexibility for specific temperature, hold time, and data collection settings.
Example Workflow

### A typical user workflow includes:

Authentication: Secure connection to the device and API.
Experiment Setup: Creation and configuration of the experiment parameters.
Execution and Monitoring: Starting the experiment and monitoring data in real-time, with options to pause or resume based on data thresholds.
Data Retrieval and Analysis: Automated retrieval of amplification data to inform next steps or conclude the experiment.
Benefits

The Experiment Management API streamlines the process of configuring and managing experiments on networked devices, saving valuable time and minimizing human error. Researchers can focus on interpreting results and adjusting protocols based on data insights, supported by a responsive, automated experimental framework.
